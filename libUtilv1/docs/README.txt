This library provides some basic common utilities which can be be used by any
component.
This include tracing, simple wrappers to some OS functions, command line
argument parsing, etc.

Note that it is up to the component designer to chose if and what to use from
this library. There is no requirement to use it.
But, for consistency between devices, it is recommended to use the tracing
and results file creation APIs provided here.
