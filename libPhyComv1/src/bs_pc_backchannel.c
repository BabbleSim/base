/**
 * Functions to setup and utilize "back channels" (for test purposes) in
 * between devices.
 *
 * Back channels are "cheat" communication channels, tests running in device
 * can use to exchange information.
 * They are fully reliable, and do not try to emulate any network or protocol.
 * This channels behave just like unix pipes.
 *
 * A device may open one or several channels to any other device
 * (Note that both devices need to open the channels or the other side will be
 * blocked)
 *
 * Each channel is bidirectional
 * Each channel is assigned a channel_id on creation, all subsequent operations
 * towards that channel will use that channel_id
 *
 * What is carried in the channel is fully up to the user. But note:
 *  * The channel is *non* *blocking*
 *  * Before any read you shall check if there is anything to be read (you will
 *    get an error if you try to read from an empty back channel).
 *  * Writes are also non blocking, if there is no space in the channel the
 *    write will fail:
 *    * You cannot have more pending data in any given channel than 64KB in
 *      Linux
 *    * To avoid problems you should not send messages bigger than PIPE_BUF
 *      ( 4K in Linux, to be POSIX portable 512B ) - 4 bytes
