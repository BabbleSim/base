# Folder structure:

The default folder structure, which you will have if you just follow the default 
instructions is as follows:
.
├── components
│   ├── common           Set of common scripts, documentation, etc
│   ├── component_x      A BabbleSim component
│   │   ├── Depends
│   │   ├── doc
│   │   ├── Makefile
│   │   └── src
│   └── ext_component_y  An external BabbleSim component (hosted in its own repo)
│       ├── Depends
│       ├── doc
│       ├── Makefile
│       └── src
├── Makefile -> components/common/Makefile
├── bin                  Where executables are installed ready to use
├── lib                  Where libraries are stored ready to be loaded/linked to
└── results              Where simulations output is stored

But, other structures are supported.

To easily support placing components and/or the output in different folders
a set of environment variables are defined. These wil be set to the
automatically assuming the default folder structure when using the provided 
Makefiles. But they can be set to something else before calling make.

BSIM_COMPONENTS_PATH : Path to the components folder
                       By default the top level makefile assumes it is in the
                       same directory as the folder components/
                       The individual component makefiles, assume they are
                       placed inside components/<component>/

BSIM_BASE_PATH       : Path to the folder where the base repo was cloned.
                       By default the same as BSIM_COMPONENTS_PATH

BSIM_OUT_PATH:       : Where the compilation results are installed. That is,
                       where lib/ bin/ and results/ will be created.

COMPONENT_OUTPUT_DIR : Where the intermediate results of compiling a particular
                       component will be placed
                       By default the folder of the component being compiled

For the 2G4 external components:

2G4_libPhyComv1_COMP_PATH : Path where ext_2G4_libPhyComv1 was cloned.
                           By default assumed to be
                           ${BSIM_COMPONENTS_PATH}/ext_2G4_libPhyComv1

2G4_phy_v1_COMP_PATH     : Path where ext_2G4_phy_v1 was cloned.
                           By default assumed to be
                           ${BSIM_COMPONENTS_PATH}/ext_2G4_phy_v1
